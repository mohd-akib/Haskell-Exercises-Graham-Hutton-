#### Q1. Define the exponentiation operator ^ for non-negative integers using the same pattern of recursion as the multiplication operator *, and show how 2^3 is evaluated using your definition.

---

#### Ans.

```haskell
:{
Prelude| exp :: Int -> Int -> Int
Prelude| exp x 0 = 1
Prelude| exp x 1 = x
Prelude| exp x n = x * exp x (n-1) 
Prelude| :}


```

#### defining ^ as operator

```haskell
:{
Prelude| (^) :: Int -> Int -> Int
Prelude| _ ^ 0 = 1
Prelude| n ^ 1 = n
Prelude| n ^ x = n * (n^(x-1)) 
Prelude| :}

```

#### Q2. Using the definitions given in this chapter, show how length[1,2,3], drop 3[1,2,3,4,5] and init[1,2,3] are evaluated.

---

#### Ans.

#### length is defined as this in the book. 

```haskell

length :: [a]->Int
length[] = 0
length(_:xs) = 1+ length xs

```
<br />

```
length[1,2,3]

applying length function

1+length [2,3]

applying length function

1+1+length [3]


applying length function

1+1+1+length []

now we've reached base condition

1+1+1+0

ans = 3


```

#### drop is defined as this in the book.

```haskell

drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
drop 0 xs = xs
drop (n+1)[] = []
drop (n+1)(_:xs) = drop n xs
```

> Explanation

```
although this program is written in n+k patterns which were supported in haskell98 but are not supported currently. But still explanation of recursion can be given.

drop 3 [1,2,3,4,5]

applying drop

drop 2 [2,3,4,5]

applying drop

drop 1 [3,4,5]

applying drop

drop 0 [4,5]

now we've reached base condition.

ans = [4,5]


```

#### init is defined as this in the book.

```haskell

init :: [a] -> [a]
init[_] = []
init(x:xs) = x:init xs

```

>Explanation

```
here cons(:) operator is used,

init[1,2,3]

applying init

1:init [2,3]

applying init

1:2:[3]

now we've reached base condition which will return empty list.

1:2:[]

ans = [1,2]



```



#### Q3. Without looking at the definitions from the standard prelude, define the following library function using recursion.

---

#### Ans.

```
- Decide if all logical values in a list are True:

and :: [Bool] -> Bool

```


```haskell
 :{
Prelude| and :: [Bool] -> Bool
Prelude| and [] = True
Prelude| and [x] = x
Prelude| and (x:xs) | x==False = False
Prelude|            | otherwise = and xs
Prelude| :}

```


```
- Concatenate a list of lists:

concat :: [[a]] -> [a]

```

```haskell

:{
Prelude| concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
Prelude| concat [] = []
Prelude| concat (a:as) = a ++ concat as 
Prelude| :}

```

```

- Produce a list with n identical elements:

replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]

```

```haskell
:{
Prelude| replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]
Prelude| replicate 1 x = [x]   
Prelude| replicate n x = x:(replicate (n-1) x)
Prelude| :}

```


```
- select the nth element of a list:

(!!) :: [a]->Int->a

```

```haskell

 :{
Prelude| (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
Prelude| x !! 0 = head x
Prelude| x !! n = (tail x) !! (n-1)
Prelude| :}


```


```
-Decide if a value is an element of a list:

elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool


```

```haskell
:{
Prelude| elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
Prelude| elem a [] = False
Prelude| elem x (a:as) = if x==a then True else elem x as 
Prelude| :}

```

#### Q4. Define a recursive function merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a] that merges two sorted lists to give a single sorted list. For example:

```haskell
> merge [2,5,6][1,3,4]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

---

#### Ans.

```haskell
:{
Prelude| merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
Prelude| merge [] x = x
Prelude| merge y [] = y
Prelude| merge (x:xs)(y:ys) | x<=y = x : merge xs (y:ys)
Prelude|                    | otherwise = y : merge (x:xs) ys
Prelude| :}

```


#### Q5. Using merge, define merge sort.

---

#### Ans.
```haskell
:{
Prelude| msort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
Prelude| msort [] = []
Prelude| msort [x] = [x]
Prelude| msort xs = merge (msort (take (length xs `div` 2) xs)) (msort (drop (length xs `div` 2)  xs))
Prelude| :}

```

#### Q6. Using the five-step process, define the library functions that calcualte the sum of a list of numbers, take a given number of elements from the start of a list, and select the last element of a non-empty list.


---

#### Ans.
