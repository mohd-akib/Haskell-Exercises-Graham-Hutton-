#### Q1. Show how the list comprehension [f x | x <- xs, p x] can be re-expressed using the higher-order functions map and filter.

---

#### Ans.

```haskell
map(f x) (filter p xs) 

```

#### Q2. Without looking at the definitions from the standard prelude, define the higher-order functions all, any, takeWhile and dropWhile.

---

#### Ans.

**all**

##### Simple Recursion

```haskell
 :{
Prelude| all :: (a->Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
Prelude| all f [] = True
Prelude| all f (a:as) = f a && all f as
Prelude| :}

```

##### Using Foldr

```haskell
all f = foldr(\a b  -> (b && (f a)) ) True

```


**suppose f is defined as**
```haskell
Prelude| even :: Int -> Bool
Prelude| even n = if n `mod` 2 ==0 then True else False
Prelude| :}
Prelude> 
``` 

```haskell
Prelude>all even [1,2,3,4]
False
Prelude> all even [2,4]
True
Prelude> all even [2,4,6]

```

**any**

##### Simple recursion

```haskell
:{
Prelude| any :: (a->Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
Prelude| any f [] = False
Prelude| any f (a:as) = f a || any f as
Prelude| :}
```

##### Using Foldr

```haskell

any f = foldr(\a b  -> (b || (f a)) ) False

```

**takeWhile**

##### Simple Recursion

```haskell
 :{
Prelude| takeWhile f [] = "" 
Prelude| takeWhile f (a:as) = if f a then a:(takeWhile f as) else ""
Prelude| :}
```

##### Using foldr

```haskell

takeWhile f = foldr(\a as -> if (f a) then a:as else "" ) ""

```

**dropWhile**



```haskell
:{
Prelude Data.Char| dropWhile f [] = [] 
Prelude Data.Char| dropWhile f (x:xs) = if (not (f x)) then (x:xs) else dropWhile f xs
Prelude Data.Char| :}


```


##### Using foldr

--TODO--


##### Q3. define map and filter using foldr

```haskell
filter' f =  foldr(\x xs -> if (f x) then x:xs else xs)[]
```

```haskell
map' f = foldr (\x xs -> f x : xs) []
```

##### Q4. Using foldl define a function dec2int :: [Int]-> Int that converts a decimal number into an integer. For example:

>dec2int[2,3,4,5] <br/>
2345


##### Ans.

```haskell
:{
Prelude Data.Char| dec2Int:: [Int]->Int
Prelude Data.Char| dec2Int = foldl(\a b -> (a*10+b))  0
Prelude Data.Char| :}

```


##### Q5.Explain why the following definition is invalid:

```haskell
sumsqreven = compose[sum,map(^2),filter even]

```

##### Ans.

```
there is no function like compose in haskell. Correct definition should be written as following where . operator is used for composing two function.

```

<br/>

```haskell

sumsqreven = sum . map (^2). filter even
```


##### Q6. Without looking at the standard prelude, define the higher-order library function curry that converts a function on pairs into a curried function. and , conversely the function uncurry that converts a curried function with two arguments into a function on pairs.

**Hint : First write down the types of the two functions.**

##### Ans. 

--TODO--




##### Q7. A higher-order function unfold that encapsulates a simple pattern of recursion for producing a list can be defined as follows:


```haskell
unfold p h t x | p x = []
               | otherwise = h x : unfold p h t (t x)


```
<br />


```
that is, the function unfold p h t produces the empty list if the predicate p is true of the argument, and otherwise produces a non-empty list by applying the function h to give the head, and the function t to generate another argument that is recursively processed in the same way to produce the tail of the list. For example, the function int2bin can be rewritten more compactlyusing unfold as follows:

```

<br />

```
Redefine the functions chop8, map f and iterate f using unfold.

```
##### Ans.

```haskell
type Bit = Int                                                                                                                                                                
unfold p h t x | p x = []                                                                 
               | otherwise = h x : unfold p h t (t x)                                     
                                                                                           
                                                                                           
                                                                                           
int2bin = unfold(== 0)(`mod` 2)(`div` 2)                                                  
                                                                                           
chop_8 = unfold(null )(take 8 )(drop 8)                                                    
                                                                                           
map1 f = unfold (null) (f.head) (tail) 


```


##### Q8. Modify the string transmitter program to detect simple transmission errors using parity bits. That is, each eight-bit binary number produced during encoding is extended with a parity bit, set to one if the number contains an odd number of ones, and to zero otherwise. In turn, each resulting nine-bit binary number consumed during decoding is checked to ensure that its parity bit is correct, with the parity bit being discarded if this is the case, and a parity error reported otherwise.

**Hint: the library function error:String -> a terminates evaluation and displays the given string as an error message.**


##### Ans.
