### Q1. What are the types of following values?

```haskell
['a','b','c']		  | List of charactersd
('a','b','c') 		  | tuple
[(False,'O'),(True,'1')]  | List of Tuples
([False,True],['0','1'])  | tuple
[tail,init,reverse]       | list of functions

```

### Q2. What are types of the following functions?

``` haskell

		#### function		         #### Type
second xs      =    head(tail xs )        | Whatever type of elements the list xs will have 
swap (x,y)     =    (y,x)                 | tuple
pair x y       =    (x,y)	          | tuple
double x       =    x*2                   | double
palindrome xs  =    reverse xs == xs      | Bool
twice f x  = f (f x) 	       	  	  | Whatever the type of f is.
```


### Q4. Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class? When it is feasible?

` If the functions type is one the following` <br />
`Bool,Int,Float,Integer,Char,String,List,tuple` <br />
`Then it is perfectly feasible otherwise not.`
