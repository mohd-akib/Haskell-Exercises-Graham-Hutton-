### Q1. What are the types of following values?

---

#### Ans
```haskell
['a','b','c']		   | [Char]
('a','b','c') 		   | ('Char','Char','Char')
[(False,'O'),(True,'1')]   | [(Bool,Char)]
([False,True],['0','1'])   | ([Bool],[Char])
[tail,init,reverse]        | [[a]->[a]]

```

### Q2. What are types of the following functions?

---

#### Ans
``` haskell

		function			type
second xs      =    head(tail xs )        | [a]->a
swap (x,y)     =    (y,x)                 | (a,b)->(b,a)
pair x y       =    (x,y)	          |  x->y ->(x,y) 
double x       =    x*2                   | Num x=> x->x
palindrome xs  =    reverse xs == xs      | String->Bool
twice f x  = f (f x) 	       	  	  | ?
```



### Q3.Check your answers to the preceding two questions using Hugs.

---

#### Ans

`For Q1. we can use :type before any value`
for example:

```haskell
:type ['a','b','c']  will give ['a','b','c'] :: [Char] which means it is a list of characters.
similiarly
:type ('a','b','c')		  |  (Char, Char, Char)
:type [(False,'O'),(True,'1')] 	  |  [(Bool, Char)]
:type ([False,True],['0','1'])]   |  ([Bool], [Char])
:type [tail,init,reverse]	  |  [[a] -> [a]]


```
<br/>

`for Q2.`


```haskell
:{
Prelude| second :: [a] -> a
Prelude| second xs = head(tail xs )
Prelude|:}

second [1,2,3] will give 2

```

```haskell
:{
Prelude| swap :: (x,y) -> (y,x)
Prelude| swap(x,y) = (y,x)
Prelude| :}

swap(2,3) will give (3,2)

```
<br/>

```haskell
Prelude> :{
Prelude| pair :: x -> y -> (x,y) 
Prelude| pair x y = (x,y)
Prelude| :}

pair 2 3 will give (2,3)
```

```haskell
Prelude> :{
Prelude| double :: Num x =>  x->x
Prelude| double x = x*2
Prelude| :}

double(2) will give 4
```

```haskell
:{
Prelude| palindrome :: String -> Bool
Prelude| palindrome xs = reverse xs== xs 
Prelude| :}palindrome :: String->Bool
palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs


palindrome "aka" gives True
palindrome "akb" gives False
palindrome ['1','2','1'] gives True
palindrome ['1','2','3'] gives False
```



### Q4. Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class? When it is feasible?

` If the functions type is one the following` <br />
`Bool,Int,Float,Integer,Char,String,List,tuple` <br />
`Then it is perfectly feasible otherwise not.`
