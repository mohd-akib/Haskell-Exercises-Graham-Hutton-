### Answer(1) Parenthesized Arithemtic Expressions

```haskell
(2^3)*4
(2*3)+(4*5)
2+3*(4^5)
```

### Answer(3) - Correcting 3 Syntactic Errors in

```haskell

N = a ’div’ length xs
    where
	a = 10
       xs = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

` first error -> variable name can't start with Upper Case N should be changed to n <br>`
` second error -> div operator should be placed in back quotes`
` third error -> identation of xs should be aligned with a`


```haskell

n = a `div` length xs
    where
       a=10
       xs=[1,2,3,4,5]

```


### Answer(4) - Implementing last function that should take a list and return last element of it

```haskell

:{
last :: [a] -> a
last list = head(reverse(l))
:}

```

** last[1,2,3,4] = 4


### Answer(5)- Showing how the library function init that removes the last element from a non-empty list could similarly be defined in two different ways.


1. Using Take 
2. Using reverse and Drop

```haskell

:{
init :: [a] -> [a]
init l = take((length l)-1) l
:}

```

`init[1,2,3,4] will return [1,2,3]`

```haskell
:{
init :: [a] -> [a]
init l = reverse(drop 1 (reverse(l)))
:}

```
