##### Q3. Consider the following type of binary trees:
```haskell 
data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a)(Tree a)
```

##### Let us say that such a tree is balanced if the number of leaves in the left and right subtree of every node differs by at most one, with leaves themselves being trivially balanced. Define a function balanced :: Tree a -> Bool that decides if a binary tree is balanced or not.

##### hint : First define a function that returns the number of leaves in a tree.

##### Ans.


```haskell

data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)

height :: Tree a -> Int
height (Leaf a) = 1
height (Node l r) = height l + height r

balanced :: Tree a -> Bool
balanced (Leaf a ) = True
balanced (Node l r) = abs (height l - height r) <= 1 

```

```haskell
*Main> tree = Node(Node (Leaf 1)( Leaf 2)) (Leaf 3)
*Main> balanced tree

gives True

```

```haskell

*Main> tree = Node(Node (Node (Leaf 5)( Leaf 6))( Leaf 2)) (Leaf 3)
*Main> balanced tree
False

```




##### Q4. Define a function balance :: [a] -> Tree that converts a non-empty list into a balanced Tree. 

##### Hint: First define a function that splits a list into two halves whose length differs by at most one.

##### Ans.

```haskell
data Tree a = Null | Leaf a | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) deriving Show  

takeFirstHalf :: [a] -> [a]
takeFirstHalf []     = []
takeFirstHalf l =  take (length l `div` 2) l 

takeSecondHalf :: [a] -> [a]
takeSecondHalf [] = []
takeSecondHalf l  = drop (length l `div` 2) l

balance :: [a] -> Tree a
balance []  = Null 
balance [x] = Leaf x
balance (x:xs) = Node (balance (takeFirstHalf xs) ) x (balance  (takeSecondHalf xs)) 
```


##### Q8. Extend the tatuology checker to support the use of logical disjunction and logical equivalence in propositions.

##### Ans.

```haskell
data Prop = Var Char | Not Prop | And Prop Prop| Imply Prop Prop  deriving Show



find ::Eq k => k -> [(k,v)]-> v
find k' list = head[ v |  (k,v)<-list, k==k']


type Subst = [(Char,Bool)]

bools :: Int -> [[Bool]]
bools 0 = [[]]
bools n = map (False:) res ++ map (True:) res
          where res=bools (n-1)


rmdup :: Eq a=> [a]->[a]
rmdup [] = []
rmdup (a:as) = a:filter(/=a) (rmdup as)

vars :: Prop -> [Char]
vars (Var val) = [val]
vars (Not p)   = vars p
vars (And p q) = vars p ++ vars q
vars (Imply p q) = vars p ++ vars q

substs :: Prop -> [Subst]
substs p = map (zip vs) (bools (length vs)) where vs = rmdup(vars p)


eval :: Subst -> Prop -> Bool
eval s (Var c)     = find c s  
eval s (Not p)     = not(eval s p) 
eval s (And p q)   = (eval s p) && (eval s q)
eval s (Imply p q) = (eval s p) <= (eval s q)
eval s (Or p q)    = (eval p == True) || (eval q == True))
eval s (eq p q)    = (eval p == eval q)


isTaut :: Prop -> Bool
isTaut p = and[eval subs p | subs <- substs p]

```
